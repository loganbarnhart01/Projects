# Projects
This repository contains the writeups / code for various projects I've conducted throughout my education. 
Below they are listed in order of when they were completed

* `numerical_analysis_project.pdf` is my most recent project (as of 2/23/2023), in collaboration with Tyler Jensen and Alexey Yermakov. 
We re-derived and explored several regression methods for minimization such as LASSO, Elasticnet, and Tikhonov regression. 
The code used to produce the plots is contained inside `numerical_project_code`

* 'analysis_2_project.pdf` is the writeup for a real analysis project created in collaboration with Zikra Hashmi and Tyler Jensen.
We constructed the real numbers using Dedekind Cuts with few mathematical assumptions as an exercise after two 
semesters of real analysis. 

* `fourier_series_project.pdf` is the writeup for a Fourier Series project conducted by Tyler Jensen and I. We used a partial differential equation to 
model physical phenomena - specifically the location of nodes produced by different frequencies on Chladni Plates - We 
solved this PDE and created a numerical model of the phenomena, then compared our results to real world data. 

* `matrix_methods_project.pdf` is the writeup in which I explore a paper published by Thomas Jech in which he explored 
methods to rank sports teams based on incomplete game data. I used the methods along with data from past tennis matches 
to predict the outcome of the 2019 Wimdbledon Men's Singles tournament.
